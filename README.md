# SODPF-Self-Organizing-Dusty-Plasma-Fusion
What This Actually Is A fusion reactor that grows itself through resonant self-organization. No brute force magnetic confinement. No multi-billion dollar tokamaks. Just dust particles finding their inevitable crystalline form, creating stable confinement pockets where p-¹¹B fusion happens naturally.
